# BEW 2.2: Challenge 3

The goal of this challenge is to dockerize any Flask application.

The app I've chosen is [E-ZParse](https://github.com/shah-a/int1.3-e-zparse)

Note: Any future updates to E-ZParse may not be reflected in this repository. This purpose of this repo is just to practice writing Dockerfiles.
